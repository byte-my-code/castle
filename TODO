Event Handling. Implement an event system that can pass events to those whoe care about them.

    - Event base class. Should containt at least the following -
        * Name (for debug?)
        * Type (ie KeyPress, MouseMove, WindowMessage etc)
        * data (if for KeyPress, this will be the key code, MouseMove will be mouse coordinates or offset)

    - EventDispatcher class. An object that can generate events - Display, Input classes for example
    - EventReceiver Class. An object that wants to know about a certain event
    - EventKernel class. The main event loop, receives events and dispatches to receivers
        * Update. Runs every frame and passes any events out to receivers.
